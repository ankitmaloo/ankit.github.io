Welcome to my blog. Most of what you see here would just be unresearched ramblings. You can safely ignore those. 

My writing style depends on what I am currently reading, and it would lack consistency. I write when i have things to share, ideas I want to explore, or when I am bored. I am not a professional writer, so I am not going to do explicit research for this blog. I will try to be correct as much as I can. I will write about things that I am passionate about, and things that I think are interesting.
