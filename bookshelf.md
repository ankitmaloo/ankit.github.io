I sometimes get asked about book recommendations, and often feel guilty as I don't have an organised list of books to recommend, and I don't recall the names or why really well. These are of course selected ones. You can check out my Goodreads if you would like. Happy to hear recommendations from anyone. 

Not in a particular order: 

## Fiction
- Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkein 
- Harry Potter by JK Rowling
- Millennium series by Steig Larsson 
- [Mistborn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062315412) Series - This one surprised me. Written in a very American english, the plot is amazing. 
- Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
- Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
- 1984 by Orwell
- Animal Farm by Orwell
- Ender's game
- [The Mind-Body Problem](https://a.co/d/hOmYh9p) by Rebecca Goldstein

## Non Fiction
- [Pacific](http://amazon.com/dp/0062315412) - This is a recommendation from Patrick Collison. I read about it and loved every bit of it. 
- [Where is my Flying Car](https://amzn.in/d/gDOSMOY) - This was from one of the reviews posted by Jason Crawford. Makes you think in a totally different way than most other books. 
- [Feynman's Lectures on Physics](https://amzn.in/d/gDOSMOY) - When I studied Physics, I was taught in a boring run of the mill manner. Reading this book(s) changed my perspective about the subject and had me genuinely interested in the subject.
