I live in Mumbai, and currently working at Clio AI.  

### A few things about me: 

- Grew up in Udaipur, India. Love the city.
- Undergrad from IIT Kanpur.
- Started working at O9 Solutions in supply chain consulting.
- Worked at Urban Company, Impact Guru, Upwards Fintech.
- Cofounded a couple of startups
  - Blubyn: An AI travel chatbot in 2017.
  - Noomi: A community startup in 2021.   
- Now, I research and work on AI tools.

### Opinions - both weak and strong

- Curiosity wins out in the long run.
- Go deep on things because you like it. 
  - This is personal given I can only cover the width if I understand things deeply enough.
  - I enjoy going deep on multiple things. In particular - programming, writing, physics, marketing, chronic conditions. Some more frequent than others.
  - It's okay if the interest does not result in anything professionally or personally.
- AI is going to give us more agency than we ever had.
  - Many people are not comfortable with agency and do not know what to do with it.
  - Working with agency requires a level of conviction people will come to terms with. 
  - This fundamentally changes the way most things happen in the world.
