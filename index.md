I live in Mumbai, and currently working at Clio AI.  

### A few things about me: 

- Grew up in Udaipur, India. Love the city.
- Undergrad from IIT Kanpur.
- Started working at O9 Solutions in supply chain consulting.
- Worked at Urban Company, Impact Guru, Upwards Fintech.
- Cofounded a couple of startups
  - Blubyn: An AI travel chatbot in 2017.
  - Noomi: A community startup in 2021.   
- Now, I research and work on AI tools.

### Opinions - both weak and strong

- Curiosity wins out in the long run.
- Go deep on things because you like it. 
  - This is personal given I can only cover the width if I understand things deeply enough.
  - I enjoy going deep on multiple things. In particular - programming, writing, physics, marketing, chronic conditions. Some more frequent than others.
  - It's okay if the interest does not result in anything professionally or personally.
- AI is going to give us more agency than we ever had.
  - Many people are not comfortable with agency and do not know what to do with it.
  - Working with agency requires a level of conviction people will come to terms with. 
  - This fundamentally changes the way most things happen in this world.
- [Anti Inductive](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/) things have huge alpha.
  - With many things out there, the value diminishes as more people start doing it. Truly transformative changes require original thinking.
  - There is a unique learning opportunity when you apply first principles thinking to various problems out there. 
- We should aim to solve harder problems no matter the domain.

### Things I built
- Blubyn
- Noomi
- Clio AI

### Research
Just one paper. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17171)

### Things I like
- Reading. Check out my bookshelf.
- Football. Real Madrid.
- Astrophysics.
- History. Not the one from books, but specific events and multiple explanations of the same. 

### Questions
Some questions I have thought about and would love perspectives about
- Why do people have different individual personalities that go away as a collective? 
- How do people make decisions about life changes? Things are constant for a while and suddenly they change.
- What would be a good successor to paper? That is what technology can preserve our learnings for the next 1000 years? No, memory that requires a software version to be readable is not the answer.
